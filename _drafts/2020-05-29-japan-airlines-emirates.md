I've spent a lot of time in quarantine thinking of where I want to travel next
([Japan in August]({% post_url 2020-01-04-trips-planned %}) looks like it may actually happen). Given that I have no
life, I've also spent a lot of time thinking about how to do it with my (almost) million frequent flyer miles. And in
doing so, I came across Emirates as a good way to book roundtrip Japan Airlines business class awards. And strangely,
although there seem to be a lot of blog posts about booking Emirates flights with Japan Airlines miles, there seem to be
very few about booking Japan Airlines flights with Emirates miles.

Let me start by saying that this is situationally useful (though likely more situationally useful than Flying Blue
awards on Japan Airlines, which I [have also written a blog post about]({% post_url 2020-04-13-flying-blue-japan-airlines %})).
You may find yourself in the situation that:

1. **You want to fly an all-Japan Airlines roundtrip itinerary**, ruling out the great value of ANA business or first
   awards from North America to Japan for 90k / 120k membership rewards points roundtrip.
2. **You want to use American Express Membership Rewards points**, eliminating the option of using 100k Alaska or JAL
   miles or 120k AA miles roundtrip.

If you want to use Membership Rewards points to book a Japan Airlines flight, your options are: Cathay Pacific, Air
France / KLM, British Airways, Hawaiian Airlines, or Emirates. For a North America to Japan itinerary, assuming you can
find roundtrip award space on Japan Airlines, Emirates is the cheapest at 125,000 miles and no fuel surcharges.

## How?

You can find their full Japan Airlines award chart [on the Emirates website](https://www.emirates.com/english/skywards/about/partners/airlines/japan-airlines.aspx), but here is the award chart from North America (I called out the countries in each region, all
prices are roundtrip):

| To                     | Economy | Business | First |
|------------------------|---|---|---|---|
| Japan<br />Korea<br />Guam _(only from YVR)_<br />China<br />Hong Kong<br />Phillipines<br />Taiwan | 60,000 miles | 125,000 miles | 185,000 miles |
| Thailand<br />India<br />Vietnam<br />Indonesia<br />Singapore<br />Australia | 70,000 miles | 145,000 miles | 215,000 miles |

Even better, you get one free stopover on an award, so you could conceivably book a Japan vacation and an Australia
vacation, in business class, for 145,000 membership rewards points per person (dependent on availability, and
availability to Australia is tough to find).

## Bottom Line

If you want to use Membership Rewards points to book a Japan Airlines roundtrip ticket, Emirates is the cheapest
transfer option for US to Japan itineraries, and there is the potential for a lot of value in a business class award to
Australia with a stopover in Japan for 145,000 miles.
