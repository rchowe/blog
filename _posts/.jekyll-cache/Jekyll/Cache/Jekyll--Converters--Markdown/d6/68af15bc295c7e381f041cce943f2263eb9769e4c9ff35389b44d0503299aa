I"÷	<p>As a fun project with my Raspberry Pi, I decided to try to build a PCR machine.
<!--more-->
This is an attempt to get to know a little more about electrical engineering, and as a cool way to start doing biology at home. There already is an <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Arduino-PCR-thermal-cycler-for-under-85/">instructibles post on how to build a PCR machine for under $85</a> using an Arduino mini, however I figured that since I already had a Pi, Iâ€™d use that and see if I could do it for slightly less. This is still a work in progress; up until now Iâ€™ve really just ordered parts, and havenâ€™t started putting anything together yet.</p>

<p>I am using the following materials to build my PCR machine:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Raspberry Pi Model B</strong> ($35, Amazon). To avoid having to buy an LCD display, iâ€™m going to make the machine internet controlled, effectively excluding the use of the model A. Iâ€™d like to use the model B+, but I already had a B.</li>
  <li><strong>Makerbot Aluminium Heater Block</strong> ($5, Amazon). This is a heater block with pre-drilled 6 mm holes in it and a spot for a thermocouple. I expect to have to widen the hole very slightly to accomodate PCR tubes.</li>
  <li><strong>150 Î©, 50 W Wirewound Resistors</strong> ($5 ea., Mouser). I use two of these resistors in series to heat the heating block.</li>
  <li><strong>5 V Raspberry Pi Cooling Fan</strong> ($7, Amazon). I used this instead of a more common 12 V computer fan so that I could run it directly off of the Piâ€™s 5V source.</li>
  <li><strong>5 V-controllable 10 A relay</strong> ($7, Amazon). For turning power to the resistors off/on.</li>
  <li><strong>MCP3008-I/P Analog to Digital Converter</strong> ($7, Amazon). This is for reading the thermocouple voltages using the Piâ€™s GPIO. I could have bought a combined pre-made amplifier and A-D converter for about the same price, but I decided it would be more interesting to build my own.</li>
  <li><strong>Type K Thermocouple</strong> ($12, Amazon). Iâ€™m not sure if the model I ordered is going to work because of the long probe; Iâ€™m investigating whether or not I can take the probe off.</li>
  <li><strong>Arctic Silver Thermal Paste</strong> ($8, Amazon).</li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally, I used jumper wire and a breadboard to prototype the low voltage components, and a power supply I already had to supply the high voltage components.</p>

<p>I also drew up some <a href="/assets/PCR.pdf">circuit diagrams</a> of how I intend to put everything together.</p>
