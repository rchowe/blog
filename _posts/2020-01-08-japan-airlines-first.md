I like flying in the pointy end of the plane. There, I said it. I have annoyed my family to no end talking about it.
Arguably, I have a problem.

My friend and I are going to Japan using the frequent flyer miles and credit card points I've built up. We booked
Japan Airlines business class for 60,000 AA miles. I should have been happy with that.

Except American Airlines allows free changes to awards in certain circumstances. So I was faced with the option: be
happy with what I have, or check every day for award seats in First like some kind of obsessed person.

You can guess which option I chose.

## Why I Did It

Here is the AA award chart for a one way ticket from the Mainland US or Canada to Asia 1 (which includes Japan). Since
it is difficult to find saver award availability on AA flights, the award chart is most useful when booking partner
airlines such as Japan Airlines.

| Cabin           | Miles (off-peak) | Miles  |
| --------------- |-----------------:|-------:|
| Economy         | 32,500           | 35,000 |
| Premium Economy | -                | 50,000 |
| Business        | -                | 60,000 |
| First           | -                | 80,000 |

First Class costs 20,000 miles more than Business Class. You get a lie flat bed with both, and the window seats in
business class on Japan Airlines' intercontinental 787s and 777s are amazing, but I thought the extra 20,000 miles per
person would be worth it for the experience, especially with a friend.

There are some other notable programs that allow booking JAL. In addition to the oneworld airlines, you can also book
with Air France / KLM Flying Blue and Emirates Skywards (and it seems possibly China Eastern and Bangkok Airways).

## The JAL Method of Releasing Award Seats

Ah the culture of Japan... there are a lot of convoluted systems. From what I have been able to piece together from
around the internet and my own observations, it seems there are three phases involved in JAL's award inventory:

- __Phase 1:__ 360 days before the flight, JAL will release between 0-2 award seats. However, American Airlines will
  only book award seats 331 days out, so they will often get booked pretty quickly. This award inventory seems to be
  rather stable.
- __Phase 2:__ About 9 months before departure, JAL will close all of the seats from Phase 1 and instead randomly open
  a different set of seats every day. There doesn't seem to necessarily be a system behind which seats are opened.
- __Phase 3:__ About 2 to 3 weeks before departure, JAL will open most of the unsold seats -- often this is all but one
  seat in First.

My flights were for August, so I was in Phase 2 and I checked for award availability in First every day until I found
it.

## The Bottom Line

It is ultimately rather inconsequential, but it's nice to be in First, especially when traveling with a friend.
