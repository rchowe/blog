The news broke today about Apple's patent for [18 karat gold composites that have less gold in them than the standard
18 karat gold](http://leancrew.com/all-this/2015/03/apple-gold/), due to the other material in the alloy taking up more
volume than a normal material in a gold alloy would. For the Apple Watch Edition, this could represent a sizable saving
on the gold used in the watch. If we take <span style = 'font-variant: small-caps;'>Table 1</span> from the patent to be
accurate, then Apple is likely to use between a 19% and 55% reduction in the amount of gold in the watch. If Apple
decides to use the alloy with 55% fewer gold molecules in it than a "normal" 18 karat alloy, then the price of the
supposed 2 oz of 18 karat gold per watch would drop from about \\$1700 to about \$765, not counting the additional cost
of the alloy.

That said, since the only differentiator of the Apple Watch Edition is the gold case (and possibly exclusive bands),
Apple may not want to use an alloy with that much less gold by volume, if the people buying Apple Watch Editions are
competing with other gold watches. I also wonder if these alloys would affect people like my mother, who react to impure
metals, since on a molecular level, more of the microscopic surface area of each non-gold molecule is in contact with
skin than the gold molecules.
